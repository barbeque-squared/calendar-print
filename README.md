I just needed a really simple printable calendar.
Couldn't really find anything, so I made one myself in plain HTML/CSS/JS.

A live version is available at https://barbeque-squared.github.io/calendar-print/.

I might do something about adding more locales (or getting it dynamically) some day,
but in the meantime, issues/PR's for wider-used locale's will be accepted.
I also intend to not rely on the external Temporal once that's a thing.
